It seems as though we're living in a time when every one of our favorite celebrities is meeting their end far earlier end than expected. This includes the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>'s <a href=#>William Hurt, who just passed away</a>, as well as comedians (as well as good friends) <a href=#>Bob Saget and Louie Anderson</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many consider the Knighted Scottish comedian, actor, artist, writer, and musician, to be one of the most iconic, hilarious, and downright inspirational voices in the business. So the very thought of his passing is heartbreaking. Fortunately, Billy is still very much alive. Even though his career has slowed due to his ongoing battle with "It" (his wording for Parkinson's Disease), Billy's still very much contributing to entertainment and living a happy life with his longtime wife...</p><h2 id=is-billy-connolly-still-with-his-wife>Is Billy Connolly Still With His Wife?</h2><p>Unlike many celebrities, The Last Samurai and Lemony Snickets: A Series Of Unfortunate Events actor has maintained a lengthy relationship with his wife, Pamela Stephenson. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair first met in 1979</a> when he made a cameo on the sketch show, Not The Nine O'Clock News. At the time, Pamela was a writer and an actor on the show alongside future Mr. Bean star Rowan Atkinson. While they were immediately friendly, Billy was still married to his first wife, Iris Pressagh, whom he had two kids with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, in 1985, Billy and Iris ended their marriage, sending him into a very dark place. Billy had lived a pretty rough life up until the time he became a comedian. When he was just a kid, his mother left him and his sister while his father was off fighting the war in Burma. This forced them to live with their verbally abusive aunts.</p><p>"My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly," Billy said in an interview. "It's just a belief that I'm not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I'm a happy man now but I still have the scars of that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The Celebs In Craig Ferguson's Inner Circle</a></span></p><p>When his father returned from the war, things didn't get any better. According to a biography about Billy written by Pamela, the Scottish comedian suffered incredible physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father. Then he was sent off to a religious school which was somewhat torturous, albeit gave him a ton of material for some of his most biting comedy in the 1990s and 2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It took Billy a few years to find his passion as a stand-up comedian, and, eventually, an actor, writer, and producer. He did an assortment of odd jobs, including becoming a welder. All the while he was becoming a very proficient drinker. But when he found his calling at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the late 1960s, Billy hit his stride. It wasn't long before he became one of the most sought-after comedians in the UK. But when his relationship with his first wife ended, his demons caught up with him.</p><p>Billy's love of the drink overcame him, as did his depression, to the point of almost taking his life. He credits his relationship with Pamela as what saved him. The pair have been married since 1989 and have three daughters together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-billy-connolly>What Happened To Billy Connolly?</h2><p>Despite having preformed in America in the 1970s, Billy didn't become a mainstay across the pond until the 1990s. After co-headlining an HBO comedy special with Whoopi Goldberg, Billy became as big in North America as he was already in the UK. Not only did numerous mega-star comedians like Robin Williams and Sarah Silverman look up to him, but Billy was selling out arenas all over the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Shortly after, his Hollywood career took off. He was cast in The Muppets: Treasure Island, Disney's Pocahontas, Mrs. Brown, White Oleander, Fido, Brave, and The X-Files: I Want To Believe. But it was really his stand-up that made him so beloved. And Billy didn't stop making people laugh professionally until he retired in 2018. His early retirement is attributed to his Parkinson's Disease, which he was diagnosed with in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm finished with stand-up. It was lovely. And it was lovely being good at it. It was the first thing I was ever good at," Billy said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Sky News</a>. "The Parkinson's has made my brain work differently. And you need a good brain for comedy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Billy claims his brain isn't the same, he's continued to show just how remarkably witty and intelligent he is in his numerous documentaries. Aside from a prolific career in film and television, which saw him nominated for a BAFTA Award, Billy has made a name for himself as one of the best celebrity documentarians around. While he hasn't acted in a movie since 2016's Wild Oats and 2014's The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies, he has continued to make his travel-docs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why 'The Hobbit' Movies Were So Bad</a></span></p><p>This includes The Great American Trail (which can be viewed on Amazon Prime), Billy Connolly's Track Across America, Route 66, and his outstanding Journey To The Edge Of The World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy Connolly's most recent documentary takes us far closer to home, however. In fact, it takes viewers inside his home for a look at his life as he battles his disease. Of course, Billy still maintains his sense of humor and his unique, thoughtful, and utterly inspiring perspective on the world. The documentary series, Billy Connolly Does, is currently airing in the UK and has yet to find a home in North America.</p><p>On top of this, Billy continues to prove himself to be a prolific artist, selling paintings and sketches to fans around the world for thousands of dollars.</p><p>While fans will never see him back on a comedy stage, his legacy continues to unfold before the eyes of his adoring fans.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Michael J.
