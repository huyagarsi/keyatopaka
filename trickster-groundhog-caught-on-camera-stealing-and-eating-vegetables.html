The groundhog, known as Chunk, has become an Internet sensation, with many people calling him the cutest animal on the Internet.</p><p>Chunk, who lives in Middletown, Delaware, has been stealing vegetables from a man’s garden for years, according to Insider. The man, Jeff Permar, installed surveillance cameras in his garden to catch the culprit in action. The videos show Chunk and his family boldly eating Permar’s vegetables in front of the cameras, seemingly unafraid of being caught.

They are also known as woodchucks, whistle-pigs, or land-beavers. Groundhogs are found in the eastern and central parts of North America, and they are well-known for their burrowing abilities.</p><h3><span id=Groundhog_Behavior>Groundhog Behavior</span></h3><p>Groundhogs are herbivores that feed on a variety of plants, including vegetables, fruits, and flowers. They are active during the day and spend most of their time above ground, foraging for food and basking in the sun. However, they also spend a significant amount of time underground in their burrows, which can be up to six feet deep and 20 feet long.</p><p>Groundhogs are also known for their hibernation behavior. They typically hibernate from late fall to early spring, during which time their heart rate and body temperature drop significantly. They live off their stored body fat during this time and emerge from their burrows in the spring when the weather warms up.</p><h3><span id=The_Trickster_Aspect>The Trickster Aspect</span></h3><p>The groundhog’s behavior has earned it a reputation as a trickster in popular culture. This is due in part to their ability to dig extensive burrow systems, which can cause damage to gardens, lawns, and other areas. Additionally, groundhogs are known for their tendency to steal food, as seen in the viral video of a groundhog eating stolen vegetables on camera.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that groundhogs are simply following their natural instincts when they behave in these ways. They are not intentionally trying to cause harm or mischief. In fact, groundhogs play an important role in their ecosystem by aerating the soil and providing food for predators such as foxes and hawks.</p><p>Overall, the groundhog is a fascinating and important member of the animal kingdom. While their behavior may sometimes be seen as mischievous, it’s important to remember that they are simply following their natural instincts and playing their part in the ecosystem.</p><h2><span id=Caught_in_the_Act_Internets_Cutest_Thief>Caught in the Act: Internet’s Cutest Thief</span></h2><h3><span id=The_Stolen_Vegetables_Incident>The Stolen Vegetables Incident</span></h3><p>In September 2023, a groundhog named Chunk was caught on camera stealing vegetables from Jeff Permar’s garden in Middletown, Delaware.
