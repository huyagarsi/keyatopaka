Harry Styles first rose to fame as part of the boyband One Direction. In addition to Harry, One Direction was made up of <a href=#>Niall Horan</a>, <a href=#>Liam Payne</a>, <a href=#>Louis Tomlinson</a>, and formerly, <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>. The group was formed after all five members were passed over for inclusion in the "Boys" category during the 2010 season of the British series of "The X Factor".
