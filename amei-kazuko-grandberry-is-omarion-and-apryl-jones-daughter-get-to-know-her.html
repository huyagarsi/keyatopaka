Her mother, on the other hand, is an actress who is best known for her roles in movies such as Angel, Casting The Net, and I Got the Hook Up 2. In light of the lavish party that her parents threw her some years back, it’s time to get to know the celebrity child better.</p><h3><strong>Summary of A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> A’mei Kazuko Grandberry</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 7, 2016</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States</li><li><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Age:</strong> 7 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Islam</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Parents:</strong> Omari Ishmael Grandberry (father), Apryl Shantell Jones (mother)</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> 1, Megaa Omari Grandberry (brother)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the second child and only daughter of Omarion and his ex-girlfriend Apryl Jones</li></ul><h2><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry Is 7 Years Old</strong></h2><p>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry was born on March 7, 2016, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America. Her birth sign is Pisces, and she is only 7 years old. Given that she was born in the United States, A’mei is an American citizen. Nevertheless, there is more to the national and ethnic identity of the celebrity child.</p><p>On her father’s side, she is largely African-American but on her mother’s side, her ethnic and national heritage consists of Taiwanese, Chinese, Mongolian, African American, and Native American.</p><p>As a matter of fact, her name A’mei Kazuko, which means a beautiful harmonious child, originated from her Asian heritage, with Mei meaning beautiful in Chinese and Kazuko meaning harmonious child in Japanese.</p><h2><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Parents Are Celebrities</strong></h2><p>Speaking of parents, A’mei Kazuko Grandberry is the second child of African American singer and songwriter Omarion, who he had with his ex-girlfriend, singer, actress, and reality TV star, Apryl Jones.</p><p>Born Omari Ishamael Grandberry on November 12, 1984, in Inglewood, California, United States, to Leslie Burrell and Trent Grandberry, A’mei Kazuko’s father took the stage name Omarion after joining the boy band B2K in 1999.</p><p>The band was a successful one at the time as they toured with Lil Bow Wow before releasing their debut single, Uh Oh, in 2001. The following year, on March 12, 2002, they released their debut self-titled album B2K.</p><p>After the dissolution of the band in 2004, A’mei Kazuko’s father ventured out on his own before releasing his first solo album, “O,” on February 22, 2005. He received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album for the album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards.</p><p>He has accomplished a lot as a musician, but he has also shown that he has a wide range of talents which include acting, as can be seen from his several lead roles in movies such as You Got Served (2004), Fat Albert (2004), The Proud Family (2005), Feel The Noise (2007), Somebody Help Me (2007), and Somebody Help Me 2 (2010).</p><p>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s mother was born Apryl Shantel Jones on December 15, 1986, in Chicago, Illinois, United States, a fact that makes her a US citizen. Not much is known about A’mei’s maternal grandparents except for the fact that her mother’s mother has Taiwanese, Chinese, and Mongolian heritage, while her mother’s father is of African American and Native American descent.</p><p>While she is largely known for her time as a singer and an actress in the entertainment industry, A’mei’s mother, Apryl Jones, began her professional career in the medical profession while working at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after bagging a Bachelor’s degree in Radiation Science.</p><p>A music career was not the easiest for Apryl Jones as she found it quite challenging to break out as a singer despite several auditions and appearances on several musical shows such as American Idol, Search For The Next Doll, and Making The Band.</p><p>In a bid to maintain her showbiz dream, she eventually ventured into the world of acting, where she has found a relative amount of success after landing acting roles in movies and reality TV series such as Good Morning Lala Land (2018), You Hittin’ Dat (2019), I Got The Hook Up 2 (2019), Angel (2019), Casting The Net (2020), Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood (2018-2019), and Black Card Revoked (2018) among several others.</p><h3><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Parents Are No Longer Together</strong></h3><p>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry was only a few months old when her parents ended their relationship. At the time of her birth in 2016, they had already been a couple, albeit an unmarried couple, for three years.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/omarion-apryl-jones-1.jpg alt="A'mei Kazuko Grandberry" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Given their respective musical careers, it should come as no surprise that they met when Apryl was a backup singer to Omarion. They officially began dating in 2013, got engaged in 2014, and spent a few happy years as a couple before deciding to end the relationship three years in.</p><p>They never publicly gave a reason for their break up, but it is a well-known fact that it was not laced with acrimony, and the former couple has even managed to remain civil toward each other for the sake of their children.</p><p>At this point, it is important to point out that A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s parents welcomed her older brother Megaa Omari Grandberry on August 7, 2014, almost two years before she was born. Following their separation, A’mei and her brother were placed in the sole custody of their father but with vibration rights for their mom, who revealed she allowed her ex to have full custody because she had to work.</p><h3><strong>A’mei Kazuko Grandberry’s Parents Threw Her a Lavish Party For Her 4th Birthday Celebration</strong></h3><p>Apryl Jones justified her decision to work more with a lavish lipstick-themed party to commemorate her daughter’s 4th birthday.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Amei-Kazuko-Grandberry-1.jpg alt="Amei Kazuko Grandberry" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The party was excellently planned by Apryl’s best friend, Xtina Milani. A’mei’s guests were treated to spa treatments from Pretty Princess Spa & Party, a cotton candy cart, a photo booth, a fruit cart, as well as food catered by Homemade Bites. The dessert was a pink, lipstick-shaped multi-tiered birthday cake by Shirin Bakery.</p><p>Photographed by Errisson Lawrence, A’Mei was dressed elegantly in a frilly unicorn-inspired dress that she combined astutely with a denim vest and lace-up combat boots. Information on the guest list is private for now, but A’mei’s father took the time to wish her a happy birthday via his social media platforms.</p><p>Her mother, on the other hand, made an Instagram post about how much her life had changed for the better because of A’mei’s presence in it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZK6uschmopqypaC8brPRmqWdmpWnv7p5yKxkqKWRp7awuoyapZ1lkaW%2FuriMo6annaNisaLBxqGrnqpdnLK1edOoZKSmn6x6qbHRaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famei-kazuko-grandberry-is-omarion-and-apryl-jones-daughter-get-to-know-her.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dave-hollis-bio-wiki-age-family-wife-career-books-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dave-hollis-bio-wiki-age-family-wife-career-books-and-net-worth.html>Dave Hollis Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Wife, Career, Books, and Net Worth.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10126672-nba-rumors-demar-derozan-to-wait-on-paul-george-contract-amid-bulls-clippers-buzz.html>NBA Rumors: DeMar DeRozan to Wait on Paul George Contract amid Bulls, Clippers Buzz | News, Scores,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10126672-nba-rumors-demar-derozan-to-wait-on-paul-george-contract-amid-bulls-clippers-buzz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
