<time>06 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Kareena Kapoor’s Upcoming Movies: Kareena Kapoor had done several glamorous roles in her early career and then did some acclaim worthy movies after the success of ‘Jab We Met.’ Kareena Kapoor is set to appear in a number of films in the near future. This past year, she co-starred with Aamir Khan in the film ‘Laal Singh Chaadha,’ which was released. The movie did not perform well at the box office despite the fact that it was launched with a great deal of anticipation surrounding it. The audience did not have a favourable reaction to the film.</p><figure id=attachment_60451 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-60451 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Kareena Kapoor</figure><p>Kareena Kapoor Upcoming Movies List</p><p>While Kareena was still a student at the acting academy, she was approached by Rakesh Roshan with an offer to star in his film Kaho Naa…Pyaar Hai. She ultimately came to the conclusion that her part in the film would be lessened in favour of Hrithik Roshan, the son of the film’s director, and made the decision to withdraw from the production. Then J. P. Dutta’s Refugee, which was Abhishek Bachchan’s debut movie, was brought up. The film Refugee, in which she appeared, was only a moderate financial success, but the actress won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her work in the film. Her debut film was Yaadein, and she went on to work with Tusshar Kapoor in the films Ajnabee and Asoka.</p><p>Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai was the name of her second film. In spite of the film’s lacklustre performance at the box office, critics gave Kareena positive reviews for her role. After playing the role of Pooja, often known as Poo, in the successful Bollywood film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, she rose to prominence as a style icon. She was honoured with a special award from Filmfare for her exceptional performance in the role of a prostitute in the film Chameli.</p><p>Dolly Mishra, played by Kareena Kapoor in the film Omkara, was modelled after Shakespeare’s Desdemona, who appeared in Othello. The work that Kareena did in this movie, which Vishal Bhardwaj directed, contributed to the actress’s growing reputation as a talented performer. Kareena Kapoor was propelled to the forefront of notice in Bollywood with the film Jab We Met, which was directed by Imtiaz Ali and released in 2007. The film not only displayed her chemistry with Shahid Kapoor but also placed her in the league of effortless actors.</p><p>Scroll down to see the full list of Kareena Kapoor’s upcoming film projects and appearances. In this section of the article, we will examine Kareena Kapoor’s next film projects.</p><h2>Kareena Kapoor Upcoming Movies List 2022, 2023</h2><p>After getting married to Saif Ali Khan and having a child, Kareena Kapoor has appeared in a relatively limited number of movies since the birth of their child. She has been selecting an extremely limited number of roles that are a good fit for her, and she only acts in one film per year. Her most recent film, “Laal Singh Chaddha,” has been deemed a financial failure at the box office due to the meagre receipts it has collected over its whole run. I really hope she becomes involved in some more major projects and finds success again soon.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_background class=mw-headline>Early life and Background</span></h2><p>Bebo Kapoor is the younger daughter of actors Randhir Kapoor and Babita, and she was born on September 21, 1980 in Bombay (which is now known as Mumbai). Her older sister Karisma is also an actress. She is the maternal granddaughter of actor Hari Shivdasani, the paternal granddaughter of actor Raj Kapoor, and the great-granddaughter of director Prithviraj Kapoor. Raj Kapoor is her maternal grandfather, while Prithviraj Kapoor is her paternal grandfather. Her uncle, the actor Rishi Kapoor, has the same profession as her cousin, the actor Ranbir Kapoor, who is also an actor. According to Kapoor, her mother read the book Anna Karenina while she was pregnant with her, and that’s where the name “Kareena” came from. On her father’s side, she is of Punjabi and Hindu descent, while on her mother’s side, she is of Sindhi and Hindu lineage, along with some British ancestry.</p><p>Kapoor, who once described herself as a mischievous and spoiled child, became interested in acting after watching movies beginning at an early age. In particular, the performances of actresses Nargis and Meena Kumari served as a source of motivation for her. Despite the fact that she came from a film family, her father was against the idea of women working in the film industry. He considered that doing so was incompatible with the traditional roles of caregiving and responsibility that fall to women in the home. This resulted in a disagreement between her parents, and it wasn’t until October 2007 that they were able to patch things up and live together again. She was brought up by her mother, who held a number of jobs in order to provide for her kids up until the time that Karisma made her debut as an actress in 1991. Despite the fact that her father was absent for the majority of her childhood, Kapoor mentioned that he played an essential part in her life.</p><p>Jamnabai Narsee School, located in Mumbai, was Kapoor’s first stop, followed by Welham Girls’ School, located in Dehradun. She went to the school in order to fulfil her mother’s expectations, but she subsequently revealed that she had enjoyed the experience. According to Kapoor, despite the fact that she achieved good ratings in all of her studies with the exception of mathematics, she was not academically inclined. After receiving her diploma from Welham, she moved back to Mumbai and enrolled at the Mithibai College of Commerce for a total of two years. After that, Kapoor enrolled in a microcomputers summer session class at the Harvard Summer School in the United States. The class was scheduled to last for three months. Later on, when she had more time on her hands, she decided to pursue a career in law and enrolled in the Government Law College in Mumbai. It was around this time that she discovered her lifelong love of reading. However, after finishing the first year of her studies, she made the decision to pursue her interest in acting, despite the fact that she later regretted not completing her education. She started out her acting career by enrolling in a school in Mumbai that was run by Kishore Namit Kapoor, who was a faculty member at the Film and Television Institute of India.</p><h2><span id=Public_image_and_character class=mw-headline>Public image and character</span></h2><p>Kapoor has earned a reputation for discussing her personal life without any sort of reserve due to the casual way in which she interacts with the media. She went to numerous award ceremonies and other events with her family when she was a young child. She also accompanied Karisma to the set of movies when she was working. In an interview with Filmfare, she discussed how her upbringing in a family with a background in the film industry was essential in her development of a sense of professionalism and dedication to her job. In India, the media has taken an interest in Kapoor’s personal life, reporting on topics such as her weight and her relationship with the actor Saif Ali Khan. Since 2007, the pair, who have been called “Saifeena” by the entertainment media, has been one of the country’s most-reported celebrity tales, and Kapoor has given birth to their sons in both 2016 and 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1663435407_842_List-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-Kareena-Kapoor.jpg><h2><span id=Performances:_technique_and_analysis class=mw-headline>Performances: Technique and Analysis</span></h2><p>Others have criticised Kapoor for being arrogant and vain, an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham… While some members of the press have described Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticised her for being arrogant and vain (2001). Her following appearances in films portraying roles that were conceptually similar to those she had played in the past helped solidify both her off-screen and on-screen personae. Before the release of the film Chameli (2004), in which she portrayed a sex worker, Kapoor declared that she would never work in the industry “The picture that people have of you will always accompany you about, regardless of the role you play in a movie or television show. I am attempting to subvert this image by adapting my appearance to be more screen-friendly and less image-friendly.” Chameli assisted Kapoor in reinventing her on-screen presence, and Kapoor later revealed that Chameli had helped her realise that the media frequently mistook her forthrightness and candour for an air of superiority.</p><p>Her outspoken ideas and her independence have been pointed out as having made significant contributions to her profession, and Kapoor is recognised for both her assertive and temperamental nature. She admitted in an early interview that she is an introvert but direct, giving the following reasoning: “My outlook on life, movies, and pretty much everything else encompasses unwavering confidence and unquestionable assurance in my own abilities. Doing what I believe to be the correct thing is very important to me. Because I am sometimes a tangle of contradictions, it is difficult to put a finger on who I am.” Journalist Subhash K. Jha elaborated that despite the fact that following this strategy has occasionally resulted in a loss of professional opportunities, it is “which is one of the reasons why she is so popular among the younger generation that holds the belief that self-respect is the highest form of creativity. She does not spare a single thought for the things that have passed or for the things that are just around the next bend in the road because she lives for the moment and pours all of her fervour into it.” While this was going on, Anu Ahuja made the observation that Kapoor’s demeanour may be an act; she may be being “cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her.”</p><p>Kapoor is widely regarded as one of the most famous actors and actresses associated with the Bollywood industry in India. Because of both her appearance and her performances, she has become a fashion symbol for young women. In a survey that was carried out by the Daily News and Analysis in 2009, Kapoor was chosen as one of the most popular icons in India. Along with her partner Saif Ali Khan, she was also ranked among the top celebrity endorsers for businesses and products all over the world. She was the only Indian actress to be included on CNNGo’s list of “Who Mattered Most in India,” and she was later chosen by Verve for its list of the country’s most influential women from 2008 to 2013 and in 2016. In 2016, she became the most powerful woman in the country. The Indian edition of People magazine bestowed upon Kapoor the title of “India’s Most Beautiful Woman” in June of 2010. Eastern Eye and Indian Maxim thereafter bestowed upon her the titles of “Asia’s Sexiest Woman” and “India’s Hottest Woman” in 2011 and 2012, respectively. She was included in India Today’s list of the most influential women in the nation the following year, which was compiled the previous year. Kapoor has been featured on Forbes India’s “Celebrity 100” list, which is a list based on the income and popularity of India’s celebrities, from 2012 until 2018. In 2012, Kapoor reached his highest position on the list, peaking at the seventh position with an estimated annual earning of 735 million (US$9.2 million).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGijoqukYryneZFpaWtlkaOxbn6Pa2pmnpmhurR50q2Yq6qZo7Rut8CrnJ6mkWK4orzOqKlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flist-of-2022-and-2023-films-starring-kareena-kapoor.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mrs-davis-recap-season-1-episode-6-alison-treasures-a-southern-california-story-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mrs-davis-recap-season-1-episode-6-alison-treasures-a-southern-california-story-html.html>Mrs. Davis Recap: Mommie Dearest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hannah-gosselin-reveals-if-mom-kate-gosselin-has-met-her-boyfriend.html>Hannah Gosselin Reveals If Mom Kate Gosselin Has Met Her Boyfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hannah-gosselin-reveals-if-mom-kate-gosselin-has-met-her-boyfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
