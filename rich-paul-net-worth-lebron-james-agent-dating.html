<time>28 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Rich Paul is living, breathing proof that being in the right place at the right time can determine your destiny.</p><p>In 2002, while walking in an airport, Rich Paul met a 17-year-old rising star in the basketball world. That “rising star” turned out to be LeBron James.</p><p>And according to <a href=#>Business Insider,</a> without Rich Paul’s guidance, Lebron would have never returned to Cleveland, thus kicking off a career that can only be described as legendary.</p><p>“Paul had been pushing for LeBron’s return to Cleveland for years, calling it ‘something of a mission,’ reported the outlet. “After James opted out of the final year of his contract with Miami, Paul encouraged the Cavs to ‘offer no restraint in the recruitment of James.’ Cleveland responded by immediately making a trade to clear enough cap space to sign LeBron.”</p><p>Today, Rich Paul is a sports agency founder who has generated wealth for his impressive roster of clientele. Basketball players all over the league sign up with him in the hopes that they, too, can replicate LeBron’s success both on and off the court. Paul’s tireless dedication to his players has resulted in millions of dollars in salaries, endorsement deals, sponsorships, and even deals outside of the basketball world. He was and remains a “threat” to the so-called “big” agencies of basketball — and all that is what makes him a true success.</p><p>Arguably, too, Paul has become just as high-profile as his most high-profile client, thanks in no small part to both his professional prowess and, more recently, his personal life taking center stage. Let’s get to know him by answering some of your questions.</p><h3>Rich Paul's Net Worth</h3><p>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Rich Paul is worth $100 million in 2021.</p><p>His net worth comes from the percentage of salaries he takes from the players he manages. According to the outlet, he’s generated close to a billion dollars in deals for his clients. And <a href=# rel=noopener>HoopsHype</a> reports that Paul’s clients have combined salaries of more than $300 million.</p><p>Not bad for a man from humble beginnings!</p><h3>Rich Paul Bio</h3><p>Rich Paul was born in 1981 in Cleveland, OH. Rich Paul graduated from high school and did not go to college. In fact, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>ClutchPoints,</a> Rich Paul began reselling vintage jerseys to make his money shortly after he earned his high school diploma, which is how Rich Paul knows Lebron James. He later founded the Klutch Sports Group after the overwhelming success of James, his most famous client.</p><p>In addition to representing James, Klutch and Rich Paul’s clients include John Wall, Lonzo Ball, JR Smith, and Scottie Lewis, amongst many others. <a href=#>HoopsHype</a> reports that Rich Paul manages 21 NBA players, five All-Star players, and two maxed-out players as of this writing. He’s ranked the second amongst HoopsHype’s NBA Agents <a href=# rel=noopener>(behind Jeff Schwartz).</a></p><h3>How Does Rich Paul Know LeBron?</h3><p>Back in 2012, Rich Paul was profiled on <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a> for the way he became Lebron’s agent.</p><p>In 2002, Lebron was a 17-year-old junior and nearly a household name. He became enthralled by a jersey that Paul was wearing at the time — a powder blue Warren Moon Houston Oilers throwback, as the outlet described it — and they struck up a conversation. Oh, and did we mention that he was in the airport at the time?</p><p>This serendipitous meeting kicked off a career that turned Rich Paul from a sports agent into a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>“Rich is now a major threat to every large corporate agency that exists,” said Chris Luchey, who represented Nuggets forward Wilson Chandler and three other NBA players, at the time. “There’s trembling throughout the industry, and that’s why some people are taking shots at Rich.”</p><h3>Who Is Rich Paul Dating?</h3><p>In recent times, his private life has gone public. That’s because back in July 2021, Rich Paul was photographed with singer Adele, sparking rumors that the two were dating.</p><p>A source close to Adele made clear that she plans on being&nbsp;very&nbsp;public about their relationship, because she’s never been happier.</p><p>“She’s not as concerned about being private with her life because she’s very happy with Rich,” the source told <a href=# rel=noopener>Elle Magazine.</a> “[She is] enjoying learning about the sports world and meeting many of Rich’s friends. She’s going with it and is very happy.”</p><p>And good for them.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC_9778-scaled-e1645329722524.jpg height=68 width=68 alt="Bernadette Giacomazzo" title="Bernadette Giacomazzo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# class="inline-block mb-4 text-h2-mobile transition-colors lg:text-h4 hover:text-main-green"><span>Bernadette Giacomazzo</span></a><p class="font-roboto text-p2-mobile lg:text-p3"><span class="line-clamp-2 lg:line-clamp-3">Bernadette Giacomazzo is the SEO Manager at Blavity, Inc.
