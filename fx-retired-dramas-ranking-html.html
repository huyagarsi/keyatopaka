The episode was filled with callbacks and allusions, which crystallized the sense of completion and conclusion that any finale would aspire to.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-3-0-0@published data-word-count=88>Now <i>Justified</i> joins the hallowed ranks of former FX dramas —&nbsp;as good a lineup as one can picture, really; HBO has more duds, Showtime fewer hits. FX’s lineup over the years has been remarkably solid, creatively speaking, even if plenty of these excellent shows failed to find the audience they needed or deserved. In honor of <i>Justified</i>’s finale, here’s a ranking of all of FX’s retired dramas, from best to worst. (Though think of it as least-best —&nbsp;even the worst show on this list is not bad, somehow.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-4-0-0@published data-word-count=138><b>1. <i>The Shield</i> (2002–2008)</b><br>As good as <i>Justified</i>’s finale was last night (pretty good!), <i>The Shield</i>’s finale is one of the best finales of all time —&nbsp;<i>of all time</i>! Prestige cop shows sometimes struggle with switching the pace between short weekly stories and bigger, season-long arcs, but <i>The</i> <i>Shield</i> stands out for how evenly woven the show feels: No one season is <i>the</i> season, and few villains stay gone forever. One arc’s horrific cover-up turns into another story’s bargaining chip; one professional misstep from two seasons ago still has ripple effects later, and the show’s central antihero has a very long memory, both for slights and for favors. Dark and brutal, yes, but also meticulously modulated: “Gritty” shows sometimes don’t know when enough’s enough, but <i>The Shield </i>knew how to dole out its gruesomeness. One of the greats.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-5-0-0@published data-word-count=151><b>2. <i>Terriers</i>, 2010</b><br>There are plenty of shows out there about washed-up cops who are recovering alcoholics. Enjoy. But <i>Terriers</i> had a more specific view of sobriety: Hank (Donal Logue) isn’t an alcoholic because he loves drinking so much — he’s an alcoholic because he hates himself, and drinking’s an easy way to have a reprieve from that. So his sobriety feels less like a miraculous second chance at life and more like a nasty punishment. Instead of being a sad, bleak drama, though, <i>Terriers</i> had buoyancy, thanks in large part to Logue’s raggedy charm, plus the chemistry between him and Michael Raymond-James as his partner, Britt. Because Hank and Britt are scrappy private investigators and not official officers, the show also has a goofy vibe, and a much beachier aesthetic than other shows on this list. <i>Terriers </i>is an example of how far richly constructed characters will get you. (Far!)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-6-0-0@published data-word-count=95><b>3. <i>Justified</i>, 2010–2015</b><br>Man, FX loves a cop show. And if you’re making them like <i>Justified</i>, why not? Because <i>Terriers</i> only had one season, it never got a chance to hit a lull, and the lovely <i>Justified</i>, alas, did —&nbsp;but a show that can combine humor, action, caper stories, and a salty spin on stories of American rural poverty as well as <i>Justified</i> did gets a pass once in a while for hitting a dull stretch. Season two is still the standout among the bunch, but other than the off-game season five, things are solid.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-7-0-0@published data-word-count=87><b>4. Damages, 2007–2010</b><br>It’s a legal drama that’s almost never a courtroom drama, with a central female antihero who wears pastel twinsets instead of the more predictable “power suit,” and the show uses a fractured timeline to tease its big mystery. Damages would be worth it for its row-against-the-tide style alone, but luckily it’s also twisted and smart. Did you know all humans are monsters, capable of profound betrayal? Well, Damages knew. Season one was the best by far, but downhill from superb is still pretty good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-8-0-0@published data-word-count=115><b>5. <i>Thief</i>, 2005</b><br><i>Thief</i> winds up being classified as a miniseries, since there are only six episodes of it, but it could have been a full-on series had it performed better, ratings-wise. Alas! A nation of dinguses ignored this, just as our nation of dinguses has ignored many a great series. Andre Braugher starred as a New Orleans–based career criminal trying to pull off a major heist while also raising his very petulant, grieving stepdaughter (Mae Whitman, as amazing as you’d expect). There is no shortage of physical fights on television, particularly on FX. But <i>Thief</i> has truly some of the most grueling, savage, and emotional screaming fights I’ve ever seen. Thanks for nothing, dinguses.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-9-0-0@published data-word-count=76><b>6. <i>The Riches</i>, 2007–2008</b><br>This is the kind of show that might do better nowadays: Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver starred as the parents of a “traveler” family who winds up assuming the identity of a rich family in a prim Southern community. The various grifts were fun and intriguing, but the real draw was the deep bonds of the Malloy family, how ironclad their solidarity was, and the tension of what happened when that lapsed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-10-0-0@published data-word-count=72><b>7. <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, 2008–2014</b><br>Don’t let the show’s often overwhelming use of brutality —&nbsp;sometimes cartoonishly elaborate, sometimes as primitive as drowning someone in a sink —&nbsp;overshadow how emotional the show could be. There’s a lot of just pure agony on <i>SoA</i>. For better or worse. As dazzling as <i>SoA </i>could be, though, there’s a bloat factor here, too, with several episodes stretching to 90 minutes or more for no good reason.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-11-0-0@published data-word-count=66><b>8. <i>Over There</i>, 2005</b><br>Maybe audiences weren’t quite ready for a dramatization of the War in Iraq, or maybe they wanted a more clearly articulated good-or-bad take from the show, which the one-season series tried to avoid. But there was something compelling here, too, something distinctive about the ways its characters were drawn and performed —&nbsp;maybe not a show for the time capsule, but definitely underappreciated.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-12-0-0@published data-word-count=89><b>9. <i>Nip/Tuck</i>, 2003–2010</b><br>At its peak, <i>Nip/Tuck</i> was one of the most stylish, intriguing shows on TV. Slinky and sultry and mysterious, naughty and unapologetic. And hell, if the show had ended after season three or four, this would be No. 2 on this list. However, <i>Nip/Tuck</i> did not end when it ought to have and instead dragged its sorry bones to L.A., where it crapped away all its story integrity and became both boring and redundant. Beauty <i>is</i> a curse on the world, though; the Carver was right.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-13-0-0@published data-word-count=83><b>10. <i>Dirt</i>, 2007–2008</b><br>FX is almost all cop shows, with a lawyer show, a doctor show, and two criminal shows thrown in. <i>Dirt</i> was about a tabloid editor and the sick sad Hollywood world she covered, replete with addict starlets and closeted movie hunks. The show was grimy as hell, but it also indulged in schizophrenic hallucination sequences (like a woman giving birth to a litter of kittens) that set it apart from a straight-up riff. Not <i>good</i> good, ever, but absolutely trash-good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-14-0-0@published data-word-count=63><b>11. <i>The Bridge</i>, 2013–2014</b> <i><br>The Bridge</i>’s motto could have been, “we swear, it’s not just another serial-killer show!” Even though it was a serial-killer show, and an opposites-attract buddy-cop drama. But then in the second season, the show picked up its game so hard! And the promise of being a show <i>with something to say </i>was truly realized! Unfortunately, too little too late.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-15-0-0@published data-word-count=155><b>12. <i>Rescue Me</i>, 2004–2011</b><br>Maybe FX should start a new rule that everything has to be on the <i>American Horror Story</i> anthology model. Because for a while there, both <i>Nip/Tuck</i> and <i>Rescue Me</i> were fantastic —&nbsp;and then both overstayed their welcomes by many, many years. Early <i>Rescue Me</i> is one of very few shows to ever depict the magical thinking of grief, how truly disorienting it feels, but also how real some of those crazy denial-ideas can be. (<i>I mean, maybe he could come waltzing back through that door! Miracles happen …</i>) The masculine posturing on the series was okay for a while, too, but by the time Tommy raped his estranged wife, there was not a lot left to recommend. The incestuous love webs? The constant character deaths, including children? On and on and on with the same old Tommy/Janet/Sheila stuff, as if Tommy is some great catch? Two-and-a-half fantastic seasons; seven seasons total.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-c7f92a098df648e1303be0cd99874d8a-16-0-0@published data-word-count=109><b>13. Lights Out, 2011</b><br>Even the worst show on this list isn’t a bad show. It was mostly just an unnecessary one, and a badly timed one. By the time we met Lights Leary, the boxer, America was pretty maxed out on gruff antiheroes who want to go straight — except this dark underbelly life, see, it calls to them. They’ve got responsibilities, you know. Like their wife —&nbsp;man, she can be a piece of work. And the kids. It’s tough out there, unless you know some guys. One season of respectable but unthrilling drama is enough to land you at the bottom of this list. Sorry, Lights Out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdgaXynxIyrnK2hopqxbrDRmqSaq12nrq%2B3yKeeZ6Ckork%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffx-retired-dramas-ranking-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./most-expensive-home-hamptons-new-york.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./most-expensive-home-hamptons-new-york.html>See The Most Expensive Home For Sale In New York Right Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./olly-murs-rebecca-ferguson-sign-strictly-launch.html>Olly Murs, Rebecca Ferguson sign on for Strictly launch</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./olly-murs-rebecca-ferguson-sign-strictly-launch.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
