Despite all his fame in Hollywood, <a href=#>Arnold turned down major scripts</a> once he got to the top of the mountain and in addition, he made the move to politics, something that was laughed at the begin with - but was no laughing matter when he became the governor of California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It turned out be another remarkable accomplishment for Arnold, along with the fact that he put bodybuilding on the map with his unreal physique and work ethic in the gym.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a different approach, looking back at a troubling moment between Arnold and a fan at an expo in South Africa. Things took a turn after a fan decided to kick Arnold. It seems like the moment was planned ahead of time, and took place for the lamest of reasons. Thankfully, Arnold had the perfect reaction to it all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Every Arnold Schwarzenegger Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></span></p><h2 id=arnold-schwarzenegger-has-a-specific-mentality-when-it-comes-to-dealing-with-negativity>Arnold Schwarzenegger Has A Specific Mentality When It Comes To Dealing With Negativity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-2023-06-30t122717-722.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arnold is well aware that there is a lot of negativity out there today, especially with the rise of social media. However, the icon remains focused at the task at hand and according to The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has certain ways of dealing with negativity</a>, especially during these time with social media taking over.</p><p>"There’s so much negativity out there. The internet chat is so negative. When you give people a compliment — somebody loses 200 pounds and you say, “Congratulations,” they say, “Oh my God, you are the greatest guy in the world.” People appreciate that more than ever. I’m always trying to figure out a way of making a better world and to be useful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continues, "They maybe have, but remember what Nietzsche said: “For every attack, there’s a defense.” If people are sensitive, let’s figure out what we can say. I say at a seminar, “When you’re fat …” and then somebody afterward says, “Maybe instead say, ‘Lose weight’ or ‘Extra pounds.’ ” It’s not hard to do. We have to make an effort and not say, “This is outrageous, now they want [to change how we say] this.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason Arnold Schwarzenegger Agreed To Appear On The Two And Half Men</a></span></p><p>Speaking of attacks, Arnold was in for quite the shock during his appearance in South Africa.

The attacker was described as a 'crazed fan' who had planned the moment beforehand, and apparently had a history of doing these types of acts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for why the attacker did this, we assume it was for extra attention and a Lamborghini... apparently. After kicking Arnold, he can be heard yelling, "Help me! I need a Lamborghini." He yelled that several times after the unfortunate moment.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger Admits He Was Jealous Of Sylvester Stallone At The Peak Of His Career During ‘Terminator 2’</a></span></p><p>Arnold would later take to social media, confirming that everything was okay, and that he barely felt anything... Of course he didn't with those lats! As for the fans, they had a lot to say, praising Arnold for his reaction to it all, both during and after.</p><p>"Imagine being so big that you don't realize someone kicked you until watching a video a few hours later," one fan writes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I honestly can't decide if I want to make this comment about how low, pathetic and just wrong it is to attack such a nice guy as Arnold; or if I want to make this comment about just how grand of the heart, body and soul Arnold posesses, which made all displayed in his reaction to the incident."</p><p>We can all agree it was a forgettable moment but credit to Arnold for keeping his composure.</p><h2 id=arnold-thought-he-got-shoved-by-excited-fans-when-the-kick-took-place>Arnold Thought He Got Shoved By Excited Fans When The Kick Took Place</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52749361-1.jpg><p>It seems like looking back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold knew very little about what had taken place</a>. Arnold claims that he thought a crowd was in back of him and shoving, not knowing he was actually attacked by a fan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He reveals, "Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about,' Schwarzenegger tweeted. "I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I’m just glad the idiot didn’t interrupt my Snapchat."</p><p>The security team would also issue a statement of their own as to what had taken place.</p><p>"Sandton Convention Centre security responded swiftly by apprehending the offender and handing him over to the police. Wayne Price, organizer of the Arnold Classic Africa, believes this incident was carefully planned by the offender, as he is known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past."</p><p>As expected, Arnold decided against pressing charges or furthering the investigation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlr%2Bvu8udZKybmKyus8bEp5ygn5Wneqi702aiopubmrFurthmmGabopbHprCMn5inZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-arnold-schwarzenegger-got-kicked-by-a-crazed-fan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dylan-neal-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dylan-neal-net-worth.html>Dylan Neal Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./23-times-zayn-maliks-oufits-slayed-us.html>23 Times Zayn Malik's Oufits Slayed Us All</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./23-times-zayn-maliks-oufits-slayed-us.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
