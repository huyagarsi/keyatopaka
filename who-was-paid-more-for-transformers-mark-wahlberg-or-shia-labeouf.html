Shia LaBeouf was cast as the lead in the film, and once it hit theaters, it became a massive success that started a popular franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LaBeouf had been putting in years of work in Hollywood before landing the role of Sam in the film, but despite this, he was not able to command a massive salary like some would think. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, LaBeouf was paid roughly $750,000 to star in the movie. This may seem like a nice payday, but Hollywood stars can command a whole lot more than this for huge films. Thankfully, the success of this movie meant a huge boost in pay for the star.</p><p>For the second&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;film,&nbsp;Revenge of the Fallen, LaBeouf was paid a cool $5 million, per&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth. This was a big jump in pay when compared to what he made for the first film, and it was far closer to what he should have been making for starring in a big-budget franchise flick. The subsequent success of the second film netted him an even larger salary for&nbsp;Dark of the Moon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For his third franchise film, LaBeouf was able to pocket $15 million, which landed him in A-list territory. Only major performers get paid like this, and his salary was a testament of his abilities to act and carry a franchise. This would be his last payday before departing the franchise, allowing Mark Wahlberg to enter the fold.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Shia LaBeouf About To Be Blacklisted From Hollywood?</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-wahlberg-made-up-to-40-million-for-the-last-knight>Mark Wahlberg Made Up To $40 Million For ‘The Last Knight’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/73889295-B619-4438-84EA-ED86FD83358F.jpeg><p>Prior to joining the&nbsp;Transformers franchise, Mark Wahlberg was already a huge star who had been the lead in many successful projects. On top of that, the performer had already been nominated for an Academy Award, as well. These distinctions helped net him a base salary of $17 million for&nbsp;Age of Extinction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wahlberg’s proven track record of success and the franchise’s large fan base ensured that the film would be a huge success at the box office, and once the dust had settled, the film found itself crossing the $1 billion mark. It is possible that Wahlberg picked up money on the film’s profits, too.</p><p>For&nbsp;The Last Knight, Wahlberg was able to shatter what he had made before. According to&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter,&nbsp;Mark Wahlberg was able to make up to $40 million for the film, which is a staggering amount of money for any actor to be making. The film was a financial success, and Wahlberg was more than happy to collect a gigantic paycheck for his efforts.</p><p>Clearly, Wahlberg made a ton more than LaBeouf did for their work in the franchise, but things have moved on without them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ray Liotta Nearly Played This Incredible Mark Wahlberg Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-the-franchise-stands-now>Where The Franchise Stands Now</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3BC0A87C-6235-4CA8-AC6D-2BDD8C1655D6.jpeg><p>After the departure of both Shia LaBeouf and Mark Wahlberg, the&nbsp;Transformers franchise has kept moving along. In 2018,&nbsp;Bumblebee hit theaters with the hopes of achieving the success of its predecessors, but its box office gross was not quite up to snuff with past&nbsp;Transformers projects.</p><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, there is a new&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;film that could be coming out as early as 2022.&nbsp;Transformers: Beast Alliance is the working name for the film, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Movie Web</a>, and the film is said to be including characters from the beloved&nbsp;Beast Wars franchise. This would be a monumental crossover for cartoon fans, and it would certainly play into the nostalgia factor for many potential viewers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It will be interesting to see how the franchise continues to perform without either LaBeouf or Wahlberg in the mix.
