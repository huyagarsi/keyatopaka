The TV adaptation of Caroline Kepnes' novel series chronicles Joe Goldberg's life, played by former Gossip Girl star Penn Badgley. He's a razor-smart bookstore manager with a twisted and shady past who has a toxic obsession over his love interests and does not hesitate to remove any obstacles to their romance, even if it turns bloody. The series premiered on Lifetime in 2018 before <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>picked it up for the next two seasons and released it exclusively in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Stars You Totally Missed In These Music Videos</a></span></p><p>The first season centers around Goldberg with an aspiring writer, Guinevere Beck, portrayed by Elizabeth Lail. That being said, it's been a while since we last heard from the actress. With the third season of You blowing up, here's everything that's happened to Lail since her last appearance on the show.</p><h2 id=gained-a-nomination-for-best-actress-for-her-work-in-39-you-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gained A Nomination For Best Actress For Her Work In 'You'</span></h2><p>Lail nailed her breakthrough performance in You, amassing a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress in Streaming Presentation back in 2018. The award honored the best performance by a female in a leading role. She was up against a handful of big names in TV, including Krysten Ritter from Jessica Jones, Natasha Lyonne from Russian Doll, and Kiernan Shipka from Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Sonequa Martin-Green from Star Trek: Discovery ended up going home with the trophy for her portrayal of the show's protagonist, Michael Burnham.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=starred-in-2020-39-gossip-girl-39-reboot><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Starred In 2020 'Gossip Girl' Reboot</span></h2><p>This year, Lail also starred as Lola Morgan, an aspiring singer-songwriter, in Joshua Safran's standalone reboot of Gossip Girl. The series itself sees Kristen Bell reprising her role as the voice of the omniscient "Gossip Girl" blogger. Six episodes from season 1 premiered on HBO Max last summer, with the second half debuting in November this year. It was, indeed, a nice wink to You as Penn Badgley is a star of both shows.</p><h2 id=became-a-cat-mom><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Became A Cat Mom</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lail is also a proud cat mom.

Titled Countdown, the film's premise centers around Lail's character, a hospital nurse, as she tries to stop a cursed and sinister mobile app from contributing to people's death. The film itself was met with critical reviews, but it was also a commercial success, landing a $48 million worldwide gross against a $6.5 million budget for STX Entertainment. Comedians Tom Segura and PJ Bryne were also cast.</p><p>"It had all of the pieces of the puzzle. It had horror, heart and loads of social commentary with the app," she recalled during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a>. "That was a really pleasant surprise. I thought it was funny when I was making it, but you never really know until you watch it. I was laughing all the time."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Shouldn't Expect To See Venom In 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=got-married-to-a-pediatric-dentist><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Got Married To A Pediatric Dentist</span></h2><p>Speaking of her personal life, Lail tied the knot with Nieku Manshadi on April 24 this year at the breathtaking luxurious American farmhouse the Hasbrouck House. However, due to the ongoing health crisis, the family only invited 22 guests. The pair got engaged in August 2020, during a romantic trip to Montauk, or in her own words, "the old-fashioned way."</p><p>"We planned everything with [COVID-19] in mind! I think we could have easily invited 200 people had it been another time," Elizabeth told Brides. "We decided not to wait and just invite family to keep it safe for everyone. We were also the only guests on property, which gave us peace of mind to be in our own little bubble."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-role-in-39-ordinary-joe-39-also-landed-her-critical-praises><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her Role In 'Ordinary Joe' Also Landed Her Critical Praises</span></h2><p>As of this writing, the actress has been starring as Jenny Banks, one of the main cast members, on NBC's Ordinary Joe.
