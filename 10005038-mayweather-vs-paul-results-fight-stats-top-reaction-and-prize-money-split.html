While that wouldn't match the $180 million he <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly received</a> from fighting Manny Pacquiao in 2015, it would be an excellent haul for an easy night of work.</p>SportsCenter <span class=acct>@SportsCenter</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A look at the stats from #MayweatherPaul pic.twitter.com/XssjsH6Stl</p><p>Fans knew well in advance what to expect in the ring Sunday night.

Torre <span class=acct>@PabloTorre</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>No fighter has made more money off pay-per-view than Floyd Mayweather, whoâ€™s been trolling people into watching his content for more than a decade. He was a YouTuber before YouTubers existed. Of course heâ€™s doing this</p><p>As expected, Mayweather was able to coast and dictate the pace of the fight. The 44-year-old was a best defensive boxer of his generation, so avoiding Paul's biggest shots was probably a breeze.</p>Ariel Helwani <span class=acct>@arielhelwani</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Logan empties the tank at the end of round 1 with a flurry of punches â€¦ only to see them blocked by Floyd.

Honestly -- Paul has been OK. He's holding and leaning on Mayweather a lot, but what else is he supposed to do? Going the distance would be a win.</p><p>One question is whether Mayweather may have actually hurt himself in the long run by failing to send Paul to the mat.&nbsp;</p><p>His fights weren't the most aesthetically pleasing and that was on purpose because he thought it was the best way to guarantee victory.
