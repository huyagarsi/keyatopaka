In the similar context, <strong>Chosen Sebastian Newton</strong> brought a great joy to the Newton family. Sebastian Newton was born on <i>December 24, 2015</i>, to father <strong>Cam Newton </strong>and mother <strong>Kia Proctor</strong>. His birth, however, was only announced on <i>December 30, 2015</i>, by his father on <i>Twitter</i>.</p><p>The eldest of four siblings has one sister and two brothers. Their names are <strong>Sovereign-Dior Cambella Newton,</strong> born in <i>February 2017</i>, <strong>Camidas Swain Newton</strong>, born in <i>July 2018</i>, and the youngest one born in <i>December 2019</i>. He, along with siblings, are brought up by African-American parents like<a href=#> <strong>Zaviera Maxwell</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 4-year-old celebrity child is still under his parent's supervision, so there's not much details disclosed about Chosen. Being born to the wealthy and famed family, undoubtedly, he has great grip in coming times. So, let's take a quick assessment to his father life.</p><h2>Who is Sebastian's father, Cam Newton?</h2><p><strong>Cameron Jerrell Newton,</strong> born on <i>May 11, 1989</i>, is a professional American Football Player who plays for <i>Carolina Panthers</i>. He was the first pick in the first draft by the Panthers in 2011 NFL Draft and has been with the Panthers ever-since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/13/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(3)-1578907133883.jpg><p>The 30 years old is also the only player in recent history to be awarded the <i>Heisman Trophy</i><strong>, </strong>win a national championship, and be the first overall draft within a year. The footballer also won the <i>Rookie of the Year</i> in <i>2011</i> and was <i>NFL MVP</i> in 2015. Like <a href=#><strong>Jeffrey Michael Jordan</strong></a><strong>, Sebastian </strong>is also the son of a famous athlete, as evident from Cam's achievements.</p><h2>Chosen's Parents Romantic Union</h2><p>Born in fortune and fame, Chosen Sabastian has a large number of a family where most of them are famous athletes. His father and mother, Cam Newton and <a href=#>Kia Proctor,</a> have a long time love bounding, and the couple has a beautiful life together.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to <i>2013</i> at Kentucky Derby when the couple first meets, it took almost one year for paparazzi to confirm their dating. Finally, after spotting them at <i>NFL</i>â€™s postseason awards ceremony in <i>2014</i>, their relationship got the spotlight, and to this day, they have a healthy love bond.</p><h2>Starting of the career</h2><p>Newton started his career from his high school days emerging as an impressive prospect from a young age. His impressive stats during his high school days landed him scholarships from different Universities, but he choose Florida at the beginning of the senior year while still at high school.</p><p>He played for the <i>Florida Gators</i><strong> </strong>while at <i>Florida University</i><strong> </strong>in <i>2007</i> and <i>2008</i>. In Newton's first year, there he played five games but turned out some impressive stats in the second year, he had to be left out because of his injuries in the first game of the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Newton, however, would not continue in the same university in the coming year and joined <i>Blinn College</i><strong> </strong>in <i>January 2009</i> after being suspended by his previous college. At Blinn, Newton led his team to the 2009 <i>NJCAA National Football Championship</i>, which was enough to get him recruited into <i>Auburn College</i> for his senior year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/13/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(4)-1578907338016.jpg><p>Newton, while at Auburn, was awarded the <i>Heisman Trophy</i> in <i>2010</i> as well as the <i>2010 SEC Offensive Player of the Year</i> and <i>2010 AP Player of the Year</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Newton was the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft by <i>Carolina Panthers</i>.

Even though they would go on to lose to<strong> </strong><i>San Francisco 49ers</i><strong>, </strong>he was rated 24th in the NFL top 100 player list. The 2014 season would not be as good for him as he was facing injury problems from the start of the season and could only finish at 73 in the NFL top 100 player list.</p><h2>Cam Newton contract worth multi-million</h2><p>The <i>2015</i> season was the biggest of Newton's professional life as he signed a new contract with the Panthers on <i>June 2, 2015</i>, which was worth around <strong>$103.8 million </strong>over a five-year contract.</p><p>Newton's team went on to finish the season 15-1 and made their way into Super Bowl 50, defeating <i>Seattle Seahawks</i> and <i>Arizona Cardinals</i>. However, their impressive run ended when they were defeated by the <i>Denver Broncos</i> 24-10. Despite of their loss, Newton was named <i>NFL MVP</i> and was ranked first by his peers in the NFL top player list. This was his most successful season and couldn't repeat the feat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/13/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(9)-1578908403882.jpg><p>The following season the quarterback was ranked 44th in the <i>2016</i> season and 25th in the <i>2017</i> season in the <i>NFL</i> top 100 player list.
