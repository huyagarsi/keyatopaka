"If I hadn't come up here, I'd be starting off the season with a 95 percent chance that I'd be sitting out more games. ... [Tim Grover] saved my career."</p><p>"If you have a kid that loves basketball, that eats, sleeps, drinks and thinks basketball and all he knows is basketball and he gets hurt and he's your franchise player, you need to hold him back from himself," Arenas told the newspaper. "If I'm saying I feel good and you know it's supposed to take six months, instead of letting me at four months run ... they should have held me back. Rather than saying, 'Let's let this guy do what he wants and use him to sell tickets' -- sometimes you have to protect players from themselves. I don't feel like I got that type of protection. But, I don't judge them for that. Some things just happen. I told them I felt OK because I wanted to play, and they did what they did.”</p><p>This is complete drivel. I cannot believe that Gilbert Arenas would publicly state that the Wizards didn’t have his best interests at heart.</p><p>While I am not a medical doctor, I have been a recovery knee surgery patient in both knees so I feel I have some idea of what happened.</p><p>After Surgery One</p><p>Doctor: Gilbert you knee is improving as long as you continue with your rehab you should be back on the court within a few months</p><p>Gilbert: does that mean I can play now?</p><p>Doctor: It is not advisable; however some light practices wouldn’t do any additional damage, but take it easy and continue with your rehab and you will be back to normal in no time!</p><p>Gilbert: Okay</p><p>* Gilbert injures knee playing pickup with teammates attempting to dunk on Deshawn Stevenson*</p><p>After Surgery Two</p><p>Doctor: Okay Gil we don’t want a repeat of last time, have you been doing your exercises?</p><p>Gilbert: Yes I have however I need to play, you know?</p><p>Doctor: We don’t want to risk re-injuring your knee it would be better if you do not play</p><p>Gilbert: But I have to people are forgetting about me, and now that I stopped blogging no one will remember me!</p><p>Doctor: Well we can do a more aggressive rehab to attempt to get you on the court faster but there is some risk of re-injuring your knee</p><p>Gilbert: That’s okay I just want to play!</p><p>*Gilbert injures his knee passing the ball to Caron Butler*</p><p><strong>Gilbert exchange with doctor in the locker room</strong></p><p>Gilbert: I thought this would work</p><p>Doctor: Gil I advised you there was a chance that this carried risk</p><p>Gilbert: No you didn’t, I was there I would remember</p><p>Doctor (sighing): Okay Gil whatever you say</p><p>This humorous back and forth represents the fact that Gilbert has always pushed the envelope and dictated his own rules. While I do not deny the team could have been in favor for the aggressive rehab, the player knows his body. So regardless of boredom, or whatever scenario you can imagine I find it difficult to believe that Gilbert Arenas could be forced into playing if he didn’t feel right. So if for whatever reason Gilbert becomes injured this year, will he have a comment towards Tim Grover who would have just ‘saved his career?’ Ironically Grover has reached out to Arenas twice and was refused twice. This makes zero sense. Gilbert does not strike me as someone who would risk his personal health and would consult with the best person(s) available in order to get back on the court.</p><p>This latest rambling and self-edifying nonsense is simply another example of Gilbert placing the blame elsewhere when it is his responsibility to be truthful about his condition. His man problem is that Gilbert is still very much a child, and has yet to grow up. For the Wizards to have any chance this year the team will have to hold accountable and to a higher standard in order for Gilbert to become a man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5uZGZ9brTEq5xmoaNixKmt02apnpmcocZutMCpp56mlZl6tbuMoKClmpWnwW6t0Z6lmqs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f256410-here-is-what-really-happened-to-gilbert-arenas.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ibrahim-yilla-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ibrahim-yilla-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Ibrahim Yilla Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./heidi-klum-teases-prosthetic-heavy-2022-halloween-costume.html>Heidi Klum Teases Prosthetic-Heavy 2022 Halloween Costume</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./heidi-klum-teases-prosthetic-heavy-2022-halloween-costume.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
