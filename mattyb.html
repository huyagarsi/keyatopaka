Prior to vlogging, he gained notoriety for his YouTube covers of popular songs. He started uploading the song cover on his YouTube account in 2010 and has been doing so ever since. With Justin Bieber’s Eenie Meenie cover, he gained huge success. Matty B’s monthly income ranges from $4.2K to $67.4K from his Vlog channel and $12.2K to $195.5K from his other channel, according to Socialblade. Despite the fact that he does not disclose his salary, it is clear that he makes a sizable income through social media. MattyB’s net worth is estimated to be $1.5 million.</p><h2><span id=Dating_Girlfriend_or_Married>Dating, Girlfriend, or Married?</span></h2><p>MattyB, who is 16 years old, uploads films with the tags of his girlfriends on a regular basis. On the 13th of July 2018, for example, he uploaded a video titled “How I Broke My Arm.” MattyB has broken his arm in the video, and his buddy Kate Cadogan has come to see him with some gifts. Matty and his so-called girlfriend gave him the impression that they were dating. She brought him a handwritten card wishing him a speedy recovery and a marriage proposal. Are they dating each other, despite the fact that she has identified him as her boyfriend? MattyB has been romantically linked to the tag, although there is no confirmation that he is dating Kate Cadogen. Perhaps he’s more concerned with his burgeoning job than with pursuing a romantic connection.</p><h2>Parents and siblings are the members of the family</h2><p>MattyB was born to father Blake Morris Sr. and mother Tawny Morris in the Morris family’s home. His father is a Texas native who has worked as an entrepreneur, an investor, and the founder of various businesses. He’s also the director of his son Matthew’s film.
