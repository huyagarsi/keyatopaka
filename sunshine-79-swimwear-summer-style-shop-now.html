We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Beach season is officially upon <i>Us</i>. And that’s certainly something to cheer about.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>We love to hit the beach, settle into a good book and listen to the waves meet the shore — with lots of SPF, of course.</span></p><p>But when we were going through our swimsuit collection recently, we realized it was seriously lacking. Some swimsuits were boring, some were falling apart, and some were so last season. In short, we needed some new threads.</p><p>Thankfully, that’s around the time we were introduced to Sunshine 79.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SN2SL09_SUS_Shot8_122.jpg><p>This brand new swimsuit company entered the scene right on time! Their playful, high-quality swimsuits come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, sure to satisfy everyone. Plus, their designs are so original and refreshingly fashion-forward!</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>We’re done with simple style. After the last few years, we want to have some fun this summer — and we’re bringing Sunshine 79 along for the ride!</span></p><p>Keep reading to hear why we’re obsessed with this new swimwear brand and <a href=#><span class=s2>check out their website</span></a> to browse their incredible designs!</p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>Bring Your A-Game To the Beach With Sunshine 79</span></h2><p class=p1><span class=s1>No more blending in! With Sunshine 79, you can stand out in fun, flattering fits and patterns that show off your personality.</span></p><h3 class=p3><span class=s1>A Fit for Every Mood</span></h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>Anyone else feel like you have two, maybe three options when looking at swimsuit silhouettes? We love string bikinis and one-pieces, but we’d appreciate a few more styles to choose from. That’s why we love Sunshine 79’s selection.</span></p><p>They’ve got it all.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In their one-piece collection alone, they have five different styles: the standard over-the-shoulder one piece, the bandeau, the one shoulder, the high neck and the plunge. Everyone’s body is different, so everyone has different swimwear needs. Sunshine 79 lets you pick from a wide variety of styles so that you can feel totally cute <i>and</i> comfortable.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And that’s just the one-piece collection! Sunshine 79 also has a ton of top and bottom varieties, and they let you mix and match so that you can pick the perfect beach look for you. Pair triangle, bandeau, midkini, and bralette tops with all sorts of hipster and high-waisted bottoms.</span></p><p>Some have string ties, some have tortoise shell rings — and we’re obsessed with all of it! You’re going to love the stylish touches on these bathing suits that totally set Sunshine 79 apart from other swimwear brands.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Cutouts, belts, fringe — it’s like the best of the ’70s came back to spend another summer in the sun.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>No matter what your body type is or what you want to show off this summer, we promise Sunshine 79 has something for you. They also have a <a href=#><span class=s2>super helpful size guide</span></a> and measuring tool to help you order the right size for you. If it’s not love at first try-on, you can easily return or exchange the suits for free!</span></p><p>Sunshine 79 guarantees 100% customer satisfaction. *Swoon.*</p><h3 class=p3><span class=s1>So Many Unique Designs</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SN2SL50_SUS_Shot9_025.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>When we said that Sunshine 79 is the stand-out swimsuit brand, we weren’t kidding. They have so many bright, fun and colorful patterns to pick from.</span></p><p>If stripes are your thing, Sunshine 79 is your brand. Their striped patterns have this retro, geometric vibe. They also have pieces that pair bright, striking stripes with zebra print.</p><p>With their floral designs, Sunshine 79 brings flower power to a whole other level! From tropical flowers to bohemian paisleys, we’re so excited to introduce some wow-factor back into our swimsuit sets.</p><p>We’re also obsessed with this zodiac print they have. It’s black and features a sea of constellations in gold. If you’re passionate about your star sign, we think we just found your new favorite bathing suit! You’re welcome.</p><p>Another reason we love Sunshine 79 is that even their solid colors are far from boring. They’ve got bright, eye-catching, ‘70s-inspired colors to choose from, so even the simplest of styles can get you noticed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Plus, their color names are so adorable: Watermelon, Sunshine, Sky Blue. We’re already having the perfect beach day just thinking about them.</span></p><h3 class=p3><span class=s1>Elevated Beachwear</span></h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>We don’t know about you, but we’re so tired of buying swimsuits from trendy shops only for them to arrive with fraying seams or see-through fabrics. We live at the beach and the pool during the summer — if we want a bathing suit, we want it to <i>last!</i></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Thankfully, Sunshine 79 has no problems in that department.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This brand works tirelessly to produce high-quality, standard-setting suits that can fit into your active lifestyle during the summer months. They even have suits and cover-ups especially designed for music festivals. If you’ve ever been to one, you know how much quality matters when you’re up against wind, dust, and three days of dancing.</span></p><p>From their looks to their fits, Sunshine 79 offers an elevated aesthetic, bringing style to the beach without skimping on quality. We love how much they stand by their suits, promising 100% satisfaction guaranteed.</p><p>To Us, that’s the mark of a company that just gets it.</p><p class=p4><span class=s3><a href=#>Take a look through their swim collection now, and see which styles you want to try first.</a></span></p><h2 class=p2><span class=s1>Inspired By the Past,</span>&nbsp;Designed for Today</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SN2SJ10_BRO_Shot10_057.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Sure, maybe they’re talking about the ideal temperature — but if you ask Us, the 79 in Sunshine 79 definitely has to do with the year 1979. All of their swimsuits and beach acces</span><span class=s1>sories ar</span><span>e inspired by the daring, colorful, and effortless looks of the seventies.</span></p><h3 class=p3><span class=s1>A Modern Twist on a Classic Look</span></h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>Dressing in classic ‘fits is fun until you actually go digging through the archives. Trust Us, some styles are better left in the past!

Did we mention they’re totally new? The company came on the scene only in the last six months, and they’re already making a huge splash (pun intended).</span></p><p>You can really see the vintage beachwear vibes come out in Sunshine 79’s cover-up collection.

Sunshine 79 has bold and hip styles to choose from, pulling the most classic and in-need-of-a-comeback frames from the twentieth century.</span></p><p>Go for something simple and classic like their Sito Orbital Sunglasses which feel like updated aviators, or go for something bright and geometric like their Sito Kinetic Polarized Sunglasses with show-stopping red frames.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Many of their sunglasses are polarized, and all of them are made with plant-based frames and sent in sustainable packaging. We love a brand that prioritizes sustainability and doing right by the Earth!</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>If we’re going to enjoy all the Earth has to offer — ocean swims, white sand beaches, shady palm trees — then we ought to take care of it in return.</span></p><h3 class=p2><span class=s1>Ready To Hit the Beach With Sunshine 79?</span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SN2SA09_BLK_Shot5_052.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>We’re always on the hunt for new clothing brands that can take our wardrobe from blah to #blessed.
