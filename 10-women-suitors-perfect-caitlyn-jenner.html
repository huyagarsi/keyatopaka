Now adjusting to life as a woman, Caitlyn&nbsp;has officially left Bruce in the past and is moving forward and starting a new path. However, as a single woman, Caitlyn will have to take her first steps into the dating world as a female. &nbsp;Although she was previously married three times as a male, she has yet to really get out there and explore the dating scene as Caitlyn. &nbsp;Hopefully there will be plenty of romance in the cards for the 65-year-old star. Since she has expressed that she is still very much interested in dating women, here are 10 women suitors that would be perfect for Caitlyn Jenner.</p><p><strong>Alexis Arquette</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/82998635.jpg alt width=640 height=420 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Although Alexis Arquette is almost 20 years younger than Caitlyn Jenner, she, like Caitlyn, knows what it’s like to undergo a transition. Alexis and Caitlyn are both used to living life in the spotlight, and would like to be able to understand each other. Plus, the Kardashian/Jenner families would be even more entertaining with the Arquettes in the mix.</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Melissa Etheridge</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/158016454.jpg alt="Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest at the Montage Deer Valley" width=639 height=455 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>&nbsp;Melissa Etheridge is one of the most well-known artists of her generation, and over the years she has sold millions of records. After her public coming out in 1993, Etheridge has also become a popular figure in the LGBT community. With her immense talent and success, it’s kind of hard to see why anyone wouldn’t want to be with her. &nbsp;Although she and Caitlyn could be a good couple, Etheridge is unfortunately&nbsp;off the market since her marriage last year,</p><p>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Billie Jean King</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/177220679.jpg alt="WTA Founder Billie Jean King And Victoria Azarenka of Belarus Light The Empire State Building" width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>At the peak of her career, Billie Jean King was the best female tennis player in the world. In 1981, when she came out as a lesbian she became the first prominent professional female athlete to do that. &nbsp;As a result, King has become a champion for the LGBT community, and has remained famous well after retiring from tennis. As two former professional athletes whose celebrity has outlived their careers, Jenner and King could potentially be great together.</p><p>(Photo by D Dipasupil/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Janis Ian</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/161431838.jpg alt="The 55th Annual GRAMMY Awards - Press Room" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Award winning singer/song writer, Janis Ian has been working in the industry for more than 50 years. Throughout her career, she has worked with numerous artists and has traveled the world. At this point in Caitlyn Jenner’s life, it would probably be a good idea for her to date someone a little more calm and laid back than what she’s used to. It might be such a bad thing for Jenner to take a break from the spotlight and really start a life. Dating a low-key talent like Ian might be the way to go.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jane Lynch</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/450844478.jpg alt="Jane Lynch At 54 Below With Matthew Morrison, Cheyenne Jackson & Kate Flannery" width=642 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Actress/comedian, Jane Lynch, has had a very successful career over the last two decades. Now, after her recent divorce, she’s back on the market and probably looking for a new partner. With her sense of humor, she could be the perfect person to bring some laughter and joy to Caitlyn Jenner’s life.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by D Dipasupil/Getty Images for 54 Below)</p><p><strong>Renee Richards</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/112785312.jpg alt='Premiere Of "Renee" At The 2011 Tribeca Film Festival' width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Renee Richards may seem a bit old for Caitlyn Jenner, but as the saying goes: ‘aint ain’t nothin’ but a number.’ Richards who became a professional tennis player after transitioning to a female, faced lots of discrimination throughout her career from those who felt that it was unfair for a person who was biologically born male to compete in women’s competitions. However, Richards overcame all of the roadblocks that were put in her path and has gone on to be a hero in the LGBT community. She and Caitlyn may find that they have an awful lot in common, and could also find themselves lighting a romantic flame.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images)</p><p><b>Cydney Bernard</b></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2241548.jpg alt="Showtime Daytime Emmy Pre-Party" width=641 height=470 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Cydney Bernard is probably best-known to the general public for being Jodie Foster’s long-time partner. However, after the couple split a few years ago, Foster has moved on and it looks like Bernard is still playing the field. As a mother of two, Bernard and Jenner will definitely know what it’s like to raise kids, and they both also know what it’s like to be married to women who are no strangers to the spotlight.</p><p>(photo by Gabe Palacio/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Candis Cayne</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/51485541.jpg alt="Carson Kressley At The GQ Lounge In Bergdorf Goodmans" width=639 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Well, it looks like Caitlyn Jenner has made some steps of her own to find her next potential partner.&nbsp;In a clip from Caitlyn’s new reality show, it looks like Cayne may be thinking of asking Caitlyn out.&nbsp;It seems like Caitlyn and actress, Candis Cayne, may have plans to go on a date. Cayne ,who is also a transwoman has been a friend of Caitlyn’s and as they say, the best relationships start from friendships.</p><p>(Photo by Bowers/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/460347588.jpg alt="Rihanna's 1st Annual Diamond Ball Benefitting The Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) - Arrivals" width=640 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Okay okay, everyone knows that Kris and Bruce Jenner’s marriage was doomed from the start. However, a lot of their struggles may have had to do with the fact that Caitlyn was repressing who she really was. Now, as Caitlyn, the two may be able to connect on a different level, and perhaps things wouldn’t be so awful. Plus, with the Kardashian/Jenner family history – stranger things have definitely happened.</p><p><strong>Michelle Duff</strong></p><p>Former Grand prix motorcycle racer, Michelle Duff, may not be that well-known, but that might not be such a bad thing. Duff, who is also a transwoman, rose to fame during the 60s for her career as a racer and her subsequent gender reassignment surgery. Not only will Duff and Caitlyn understand each other, but they’re both former athletes who have spent time in the spotlight. &nbsp;Plus, it might not be bad for Caitlyn to get involved with someone who isn’t as popular.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p>Lead&nbsp;(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for Nederlander)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWnpLqmuoysrKKsn6fAbrzEq52em6RisKK106Wwp2WamruvsdFo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-women-suitors-perfect-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alastair-sooke-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alastair-sooke-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Alastair Sooke Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zachary-levi-kids-ex-wife-missy-peregrym-relationship-667737-html.html>Zachary Levi | Kids, Ex-Wife Missy Peregrym | Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zachary-levi-kids-ex-wife-missy-peregrym-relationship-667737-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
