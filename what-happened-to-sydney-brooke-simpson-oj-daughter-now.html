It's been more than two decades since people last heard from Sydney and now that she's all grown up, most of us are curious to find out what’s going on with her life.</p><p>Sydney was born on October 17th, 1985, and she has a younger brother, Justin Ryan Simpson who was born in 1988. Before their famous father, OJ Simpson, became an NFL football player, and met and married their mother Nicole Brown, OJ was previously married to his first wife, Marguerite Simpson. In <strong>OJ's first marriage, they had three children together; Arnelle Simpson, Jason Simpson, and Aaren Simpson</strong>. Sadly, one of OJ's children passed away at only 2 years old in 1979.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>OJ Simpson and Nicole Brown met in a nightclub where Nicole was working as a waitress. When they met, OJ was still married to his first wife Marguerite Simpson, but later divorce took place due to cheating allegations and extramarital affairs. OJ moved on with his life and married Nicole Brown, but their union ended up in divorce as well, filed by Nicole on the claims of irreconcilable differences.</p><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong><strong> On April 11th, 2024, it was reported that OJ Simpson died at the age of 76 after a long battle with Cancer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His family posted the news on social media</a>.</strong></p><h2 id=how-was-life-for-sydney-brooke-simpson-growing-up>How Was Life For Sydney Brooke Simpson Growing Up?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usatsi_3356156.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sydney grew up in the limelight due to her association with her famous father OJ Simpson, who was recognized nationwide as being a famous football player and actor.

One person left a comment concerning the book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OJ wrote titled, 'If I Did It' </a>and said, "I'm fascinated that anyone is actually still debating this. OJ effectively confessed when he wrote his book, under the paper-thin cover of writing it as a hypothetical. No sane person if they'd been falsely accused of a m***** would then write an account of how he committed a crime and say, ' No, not really.' If it wasn't already obvious that OJ committed the m*****, this confession should remove all doubts. The only way to come away with the alternate conclusion is if you really, really, wanted to believe it."</p><p>Another one went on to say, "I mean, just look at the cover of the book. Does anyone think it's an accident that 'I DID IT' is printed in highly visible red font whereas 'IF' is printed in a white color that blends into his jacket until you look closely. It's a pretty brilliant cover design, actually."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fairly enough, during and after the trial, Sydney and her brother Justin were kept far away from the spotlight.</strong></p><h2 id=what-is-sydney-brooke-simpson-doing-with-her-life-today>What Is Sydney Brooke Simpson Doing With Her Life Today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_oj-simpson-s-daughter-sydney-brooke-s-life-is-drastically-different-years-after-her-father-s-scandal_bk_a1_v2.jpg><p>As we were all expecting and hoping, Sydney Brooke Simpson has achieved quite a lot for herself throughout the years. If we back it up a little bit, after graduation, the now 38-year-old took up work as an events coordinator in Atlanta. She then ventured into the real estate business, which prompted her to relocate to St. Petersburg, Florida. Sydney started her own business there and named it <strong>Simpsy Properties LLC</strong>.
