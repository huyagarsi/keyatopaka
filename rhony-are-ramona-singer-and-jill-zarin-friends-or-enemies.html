<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Real Housewives of New York </strong></a>OG's Ramona Singer and Jill Zarin have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a complicated past</a>, making fans speculate if they're on good terms after Zarin left the show. Even after Zarin&nbsp;stepped away after its fourth season, there's been plenty of drama to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">qualify as an&nbsp;RHONY After Show.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=subtle-digs-towards-zarin>Subtle Digs Towards Zarin</h2><p>Back in 2017, Zarin appeared on Andy Cohen's&nbsp;WWHL to respond to Singer's recent claim at the time that she was, "Desperate to be back on the show." She also claimed that Zarin was whispering in Kelly Bensimon's ear <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during the Scary Island fiasco</a>.&nbsp;The comments visibly hurt Zarin, as she was dealing with her late husband's medical issues while he was still battling lung cancer.</p><p>Zarin, however, continued that she and Singer eventually made up after running into each other.&nbsp;During the same show, Zarin offered a compliment to her old costar saying she's never looked better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jill-Zarin-and-Ramona-Singer.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHONY': Ramona Singer Blames New York City Mayor For Ruining Her City</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zarin-reignites-the-feud>Zarin Reignites The Feud</h2><p>In 2019, Zarin&nbsp;brought up a fiery argument from 2011 on&nbsp;Jeff Lewis Live. She told Jeff about a time in the Hamptons where she claims Singer's ex-husband Mario Singer pushed her in a moment of anger. She said, "Me and my girlfriends and my guy friend are in line for the food. Mario comes over to me and he puts his hands on me, pushes me and he says, 'I don't like the way you talk about Ramona.'"</p><p>She kept the tea boiling when she casually threw in the conversation that Mario, "got a girl pregnant," and the unexpected pregnancy caused his split with Ramona. If you're trying to maintain a peaceful relation to someone, rehashing their marital rumors doesn't seem like the way to do it.</p><p>However, Zarin's reasoning behind sharing the story may relate to Singer's distasteful remarks about Bobby Zarin's funeral during the&nbsp;RHONY&nbsp;2018 reunion. She claimed Bethenny Frankel used his funeral as a camera opportunity, which Andy Cohen quickly&nbsp;shut that down. He stated that&nbsp;Zarin invited the production team to share the special moment between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">herself and Frankel</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ramona-and-jill-feud.jpg><h2 id=snubbed-in-london>Snubbed In London</h2><p>Radar Online&nbsp;released a story this year about an uncomfortable interaction between the Bravo-lebrities in London at a members-only club. The article revealed through an anonymous source that Zarin spotted Singer and was happy to see her. However, Singer took the opposite approach to seeing into her longtime friend.</p><p>Allegedly, "Jill walked over to Ramona to say hello and wanted to invite Ramona to sit at her table. They made eye contact and Ramona turned her back and started walking the other way." Singer has been infamously known to ignore people she knows in public. Remember that time&nbsp;RHONJ star Dolores Catania called Singer out at Bravocon for refusing to snap a photo with Frank Catania?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RHONY: 10 Pictures Of The Cast & Their Kids Comparing Season 1 To Now</a></span></p><p>The source continued, "Jill and Ramona have been through a lot together so of course she was saddened that Ramona completely and deliberately ignored her in London. But she quickly shrugged it off."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ramona-and-jill-london.jpg><h2 id=instagram-live-gossip>Instagram Live Gossip</h2><p>The two still follow each other on Instagram, which would be a good sign that they've healed their relationship wounds. Zarin, however, took to Instagram Live to discuss Singer's lack of safety precautions during the current pandemic. She talked to Elyse Slaine, who's&nbsp;discussed about her friendship troubles with Singer after the latest&nbsp;RHONY season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, Zarin told Slaine she made a mistake by considering Singer a friend and that showing her kindness presented a form of weakness to Singer. She then spilled about Singer allegedly ignoring social distancing guidelines while in Florida.</p><p>"On the third or fourth week of quarantine in Boca (Raton) a friend of mine, who shouldn't have been there either, went to a restaurant that shouldn't have been open...Ramona was there...they saw her there at the bar, no Avery, no mask hitting on guys. The next day she's posting the happy family with Mario," Zarin shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "They must have thrown her out because she was staying with him then she wasn't...She's very cheap so she wouldn't pay for her own apartment if she didn't have to. This is Ramona's routine she rents her house then she freeloads." Nothing is off-limits to talk about with these ladies, even on a public Instagram video.</p><p>The conversation about Singer went on and showed that Zarin has zero issues with voicing her negative opinions about her. She and Slaine bonded over feeling used by Singer and cast off after she&nbsp;didn't need them anymore.</p><p>Considering all of the public feudings between the two women, it's safe to say that the waters of their bond are more choppy than serene. It's hard to watch friends grow apart in such a biting way, and we hope they're able to mend their relationship at some point.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna Reveals She's Team Leah From RHONY With Unexpected IG Comment</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaeernqivsRmqZqln6Oubr%2FIp56eql2Wu6V5yaKjpWWqlr%2BquoyfqaKdnpnAbrvRZpynnZ2esrR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhony-are-ramona-singer-and-jill-zarin-friends-or-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-was-bill-murray-in-groundhog-day.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-was-bill-murray-in-groundhog-day.html>How Long Did Bill Murrays Character Stay Stuck in Groundhog Day?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jack-stirrup-wiki-bio-wife-child.html>Wiki-Bio, Net worth, Girlfriend, Child.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jack-stirrup-wiki-bio-wife-child.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
