Stone Cold Steve Austin became a star. Shawn Michaels and Degeneration-X started to wreak havoc.

The main event was fantastic, a four-way match for the WWE Championship. This was Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin vs. Vader vs. Undertaker, and with those four, it was guranteed to be good.

Undertaker defending his world title against Vader was amazing, with the two guys beating the heck out of each other.
